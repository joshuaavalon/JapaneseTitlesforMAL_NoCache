#### Description
This is a rewrite version of "Japanese Titles for MAL (No Cache)" By zanetu to replace the outdated api.

Displays Japanese titles along with English ones for anime/manga lists on myanimelist.net. 
This script, unlike its cache-version counterpart, does not download cached lists from dropbox.com. 
Although slow in fetching Japanese titles, this script is less cpu-intensive than its cache-version counterpart.
